 **SECURITY GROUPS** 
1. AWS security groups are associated with EC2 instances and provide security at the protocol and port access level.

2. Each security group working much the same way as a firewall contains a set of rules that filter traffic coming into and out of an EC2 instance.

3. After that, you can set up ports and protocols,which remain open for users and computers over the internet.

4. Each security group must have a name, allowing you to easily distinguish it from others.  

5. AWS Security Groups are a flexible tool to help you secure your Amazon EC2 instances.
